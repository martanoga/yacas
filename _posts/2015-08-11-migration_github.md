title: Migration to GitHub
subheadline: So Long SourceForge, and Thanks for All the Fish.
teaser: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> for years has been an excellent resource for quite a few open source projects, including yacas. Unfortunately, for some time now it kept <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/the-long-death-of-project-hosting-sites/240169394">loosing an uphill battle</a> against <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.

As if the disadvantages in technical aspects and sociological trends
were not enough, SourceForge recently suffered from serious
[trust](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/sourceforge-grabs-gimp-for-windows-account-wraps-installer-in-bundle-pushing-adware/)
and
[reliance](https://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-infrastructure-and-service-restoration-update-for-731/)
crises. All that made me consider SourceForge more a liability than an
asset and led to a decision of [migrating yacas to
GitHub](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/yacas/7Lnio18Z7pU).

Having regained access to the [SourceForge
repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/yacas) I've transferred the
source code and bugtracker contents over to
[https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yacas](https://github.com/grzegorzmazur/yacas).
Also, the [old mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/yacas/mailman/)
has been replaced by a [new
one](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yacas). The effort paid
off to some extent with free goodies like [continuous
integration](https://travis-ci.org/grzegorzmazur/yacas) and [static
code analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1553).

Finally, migration triggered long overdue publication of [brand new
website](http://grzegorzmazur.github.io/yacas/) and preliminary
attempt at [refurbished
documentation](http://yacas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). While both
are in the pupal state, I certainly hope that they'll be ready to
replace the old ones soon.

So long SourceForge, and thanks for all the fish.
