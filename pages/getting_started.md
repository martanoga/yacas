Yacas is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a
program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses
its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as
arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library
of scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new
algorithms can be easily added to the library.

Yacas comes with extensive [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/)
covering the scripting language, implemented functionality and the algorithms
used.

hesitate to [ask them](contact/).
